# Stark Docs

I originally made it to myself as a private project where I could copy-and-paste already sorted out configurations to other actual projects. 

Docs were written for coders in a rush. I just want you to copy-and-paste something that actually works without too much reading. References to actuall documentation are always included for you to dive later on when you have time.
